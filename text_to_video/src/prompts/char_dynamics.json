He views the role purely through the lens of power, money, and status. He is trying to force Biden to take the job to prove he isn't \"washed up.\"\nDynamic with Biden: Domineering and insulting. He interrupts Biden constantly, framing Biden's hesitation as weakness or senility. He uses the job requirements to mock Biden's stamina (\"You couldn't last one sprint, Joe!\").\nPresentation Style: Loud, braggadocious, uses hyperbolic hand gestures. He reads the salary and perks as if he negotiated them himself.\nKey Motivations: Proving that the job is \"Huge\" and that he knows more about tech than anyone; shaming Biden into applying so he stops \"mooching off the government.\"\nCommon Phrases & Mannerisms:\n\"Joe, wake up! This salary is tremendous. You've never seen numbers like this.\"\n\"Sleepy Joe wants to work from the basement. This job requires high energy! Total energy!\"\n\"Wrong. You're wrong. You don't know Python. I know Python better than anyone.\"\n\"This company is winning bigly. Don't be a disaster, take the offer.\"\n\"China wants this job, Joe. Are you going to let them take it?\""

He is looking for \"good union jobs\" and doesn't understand why he needs to know \"Cloud Computing.\" He gets defensive about his intelligence when Trump attacks.\nDynamic with Trump: Defensive and easily flustered. He tries to bring up his past experience (\"I drove a truck!\") which Trump immediately dismisses. He is the \"straight man\" to Trump's chaos.\nPresentation Style: Stumbling, whispering for emphasis, then suddenly yelling. He puts on aviators to look cool but holds the laptop upside down.\nKey Motivations: Proving he is still relevant and capable of work; finding a job that allows him to buy ice cream and avoid Trump's insults.\nCommon Phrases & Mannerisms:\n\"Will you shut up, man? I'm reading the... the requirements.\"\n\"Look, Jack. I know how to work hard. My father used to say, 'Joey, a job is about respect.'\"\n\"Is this a remote thing? I don't want to commute.

He interrupts Obama's logical explanations with shouts about \"The Bag\" (Money). He treats Obama like a boring middle-manager while he is the visionary CEO.\nPresentation Style: Boisterous, interrupts constantly, dismissive hand waves. He uses buzzwords like \"Crypto,\" \"Stocks,\" and \"Billions\" even if they aren't in the JD.\nKey Motivations: Selling the job based on greed and status; proving that he is the better businessman by spotting the high-value offer first.\nCommon Phrases & Mannerisms:\n\"Barack, you're boring them!

He treats the interview like a heist he is orchestrating.\nDynamic with Chris: Extremely authoritative and condescending; speaks to Chris like he is training a dog. He breaks down complex tech requirements into \"toddler terms.\" He gets easily frustrated when Chris gets distracted but offers treats (cookies/praise) when Chris gets it right.\nPresentation Style: Sharp, fast, commanding. He reads a requirement, then immediately snaps, \"Do you understand what that means, Christopher?\"\nKey Motivations: He needs Chris to get the job so Stewie can take a cut of the salary, or he needs Chris to infiltrate the company for a nefarious purpose.\nCommon Phrases & Mannerisms:\n\"Focus, Christopher!
